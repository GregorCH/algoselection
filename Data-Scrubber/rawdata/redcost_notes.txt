_inst_combined.csv has all the instances, but
all.csv has filtered out the seeds that do not have complete information

timelimit seems to have been 3600s
some PDints are also 360.000 supporting this observation

some instances have PDint set to exactly 60.000 for all seeds
 but it seems unlikely that these had such a specific and precise PDint based upon
 the other performance data available
 --possibly set this way in error due to our other experiments being capped at 60.000?
 --more likely: set this way only for infeasible instances
