Welcome to GRIPS Algorithm Predictor's documentation!
=====================================================
Algorithm Predictor is a tool for predicting ranking of algorithms for a given
problem instance based on problem instance's features. Tool includes utilities for:

- **Feature investigation** - used for analysis of feature space using
  Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and Random
  Forest Regression (RFR)
- **Algorithm prediction** - used for predicting ranking of algorithms based on
  Random Forest Regression and Hydra approach :cite:`xu2011hydra`.
