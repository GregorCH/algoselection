Package structure
=================

This section explains package structure in more details. In general, current
package directory tree is shown below. Some of directories are omitted, since
they are created during building process, or they are not important from the point
of package usage.

- ``data``
  directory is used as a default storage place for all content that
  is generated by this package as well as for the files that are used as an
  input for the package. It is divided into multiple subdirectories:

    - ``feature_extractor`` directory where you can find all output produced
      by functions of ``feature_extractor`` module.
    - ``models`` where you can find all output produced as a result of training
      different classifiers (prediction models). Most of these results are
      used as an input for the ``performance_measurement`` module.
    - ``performance`` directory that contains subdirectories for data that is
      used for evaluation (``data`` subdirectory), a directory where evaluation
      results are stored (``plot_data`` subdirectory), a directory where plots
      created based on the plot data are stored (``plots``) and a directory
      where you should put performance files if you want to use the default configuration
      (``actual`` subdirectory).
- ``docs``
  directory that contains documentation for this package. It has subdirectories
  ``source`` where you should go if you want to modify any documentation text or
  documentation configuration file, and ``themes`` subdirectory. The later
  subdirectory contains some Sphinx themes that you can copy to the
  ``source/_templates`` directory and instantly use them by changing the
  ``html_theme`` property in documentation configuration file.
- ``logs`` directory that contains all log files produced by different modules of this
  package.
- ``predictor`` directory that contains source code of this package.
- ``tests`` directory that contains tests for the package.
